# VimSpeak #

VimSpeak lets you control Vim with your voice, using speech recognition. For instance, you can say “select three words” to type `v3w`.

This is a little toy I built over the weekend after watching Tavis Rudd's nifty Strange Loop talk here: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Programming-Voice
I wanted to do the same for Vim. It's nowhere near yet, but a start...

There's a demo/explanation of it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEBMlXRjhZY

And another demo applying it to a VimGolf challenge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy84TYvXJbk

Have fun!
